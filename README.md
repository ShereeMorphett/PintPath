## Initial approach

- [X] Setup and Familiarization
  Go through basic Qt Quick and Qt Creator tutorials, including deploying a simple app on Android. - 

- [ ] Understanding Open Brewery API and Data Handling
Explore API documentation and test API calls using tools like Postman or a browser.
Experiment with making API calls from C++ code in a Qt environment.
Backend Development (1-2 days)

- [ ] Implement C++ classes to fetch and process data from the API.
Identify northernmost, southernmost, and longest-name breweries.
Frontend Development in QML (2 days)

- [ ] Design the UI to display brewery information.
  Add eye candy, like a map, using Qt's location or map components.
  Link C++ backend with QML frontend using the signal-slot mechanism.
  Testing and Deployment (2-3 days)

- [ ] Run the app on the desktop, Android emulator, and physical hardware.
  Debug and fix issues that arise during deployment.
  Documentation and Finalization (1 day)

- [ ] Write the README.md, detailing the learning process, challenges, and the creation workflow.
    
- [X]  Prepare the GitHub repository.
      
- [ ]  Link the GitHubs.
